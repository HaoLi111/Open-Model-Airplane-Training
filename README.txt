OPEN STANDARDIZED COURSE FOR FIXED WING UAV TEAM DEVELOPMENT

Being capable of developing model vehicle is important for not only school competition teams but also for companies to train their product developers.

However the materials can be hard on people because of the lack of system for different aspects and also the varying difficulty.

With this project repository I am sharing the outline of one possible standard and also inviting you all to help write the course.

Since it is open-source, the usages are free. If you want to print it on documentation make sure that you refer to the project on the book information.

The difficulty of this course is set to be extending the knowledge span of high school student (assuming the reader have the least knowledge base of a normal high school student) and also introducing the basics of key ideas relevant to further studies of aviation.

The OpenUAVcourseForTeam-FW is initiated by Hao Li on 21/Nov/2018 and maintain/ contributed by a number of contributers (see list of contributors). I would like to thank all contributors for making this project possible for the world. The main branch is maintained by Hao Li. However if you want to modify the distribution feel free to start your version of it. As long as you use the same license it is feasible.

Thank you for reading the introduction and please star, watch, or share this repository.
